# Heart-Disease-NN
Building, compiling, and training a neural network which predicts the presence of heart disease.

In this script we use the Heart Disease UCI dataset available on Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci

After plotting and reviewing the effectiveness of the model on a validation set, it is reasonable to expect a classification accuracy of around 85% on new data after training for ~35 epochs, up to randomness in initializations.
